## Introduction

<!-- You have to wrap the "left" and "right" half of these headings in spans by
hand -->

   I am a third-year Information Technology student at Sai Gon University (SGU), actively seeking an internship opportunity in software engineering. I possess a strong willingness to learn, thrive under pressure, and consistently meet deadlines. My goal is to gain hands-on experience by applying my academic knowledge to real-world projects, working closely with experienced professionals, and continuously improving my practical skills.

   In the short term, I aim to become a valuable intern by contributing effectively to team projects while learning from mentors and colleagues. Looking ahead, I am committed to growing into a skilled software engineer who can deliver high-quality solutions, communicate well with foreign partners, and take on increasing responsibilities to support organizational success.

## Projects

### <span>Q&A Chatbot - Law Rights 2015</span> <span>12/2024 – 03/2025</span>
   
A website (built during a Hackathon organized by SGU) to support learning my "Pháp Luật Đại Cương" subject more effectively:

   - Description: A chatbot web app like Gemini that allows users to ask questions related to the 2015 Civil Code.
   - Integrated AI Q&A using Gemini API.
   - Supabase: Created a client with `supabaseUrl` and `supabaseKey` to interact with the database, including configurations like `autoRefreshToken`, `persistSession`, and `detectSessionInUrl` for Google Auth.
   - Frontend built with React: login/logout interface, chat input, and history display.
   - Backend built with Python (FastAPI): extract PDF data → JSON → FAISS (vector data) for chatbot handling. REST API connects frontend and backend.
   - Technologies: React, Python, Supabase, Gemini API, RAG System.
